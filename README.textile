h1. OMG IT WORKS!

# You need a Kindle
# You need node.js v0.3.x and wkhtmltopdf (go grab the latest version)
# You need a "Postmark":http://postmarkapp.com/ API key setup with an email that your Kindle will accept. Something like johndoe@kindle.com
# You need to generate a key. "GRC":https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm does wonders
# You need some npm modules (just start running things and install as appropriate)
# You need to make @config.json@ with all this stuff.

bq.. {
  "key": "yourkey",
  "postmark": "postmark key",
  "email": {
    "from": "your email",
    "to": "your kindle email"
  }
}

p. Now make a bookmarklet for yourself with:

bq.. javascript:(function() {  var img = new Image();  img.src = "http://where.you.host.it.com/?u=" + encodeURIComponent(document.location.href) + "&key=yourkey&t=" + (new Date()).getTime();})();

p. Hit it on some pages! You'll get a PDF on your Kindle. Well, you should!
